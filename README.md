# Instigo App

This is the git repository for the Instigo app, an App developed as a FCUL project with professor 
Mario Calha.  To see all changes made and to see the current state of the project, please read 
the changelog. 

## What is Instigo
Instigo is an App that allows it's users to subscribe to communities and receive events from 
those communities. It also allows editors to create communities and events, therefore being
a system for dissemination of events.

## What is missing
Instigo is still in it's early development stage, but key features that are missing are:
- Security and ways to verify data being received by the back end
- Event notifications
- Editable user profile
- Editable event and community descriptions

## Current version
Currently Instigo is in version 0.1.4 alfa
